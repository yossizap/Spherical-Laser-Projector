Arduino Draw Format 1.0:

Represents a drawing using a binary graphic command(s).
Each command is 8 bits, followed by optional little-endian 16 bits arguments,
Some commands have an 8 bits point-count extension.
All points are absolute from 0,0 - top left corner of the drawing.

command + [arguments...]
	0										= "drawing end" - end of drawing, last command
	1										= "drawing close" go to start, last command
	2	x									= "drawing horizontal line" go to (x,y0)
	3	y									= "drawing vertical line" go to (x0,y)
	4	x0,y0								= "drawing start" go to (x0,y0)
	5	x0,y0								= "drawing restart" go to start, and start from (x0,y0)
	6	x,y									= "drawing line" from (x0,y0) to (x,y)
	7	n,...,xn,yn							= "drawing lines" from (x0,y0) to (xn,yn)
	8	xa,ya,x,y							= "drawing quadratic bezier" curve from (x0,y0) to (x,y)
	9	n,xa,ya,x,y,...,xan,yan				= "drawing quadratic beziers" curves from (x0,y0) to (xan,yan)
	10	xa,ya,xb,yb,x,y						= "drawing cubic bezier" curve from (x0,y0) to (x,y)
	11 	n,xa,ya,xb,yb,x,y,xan,yan,xbn,ybn	= "drawing cubic beziers" curves from (x0,y0) to (xbn,ybn)
	12 	xr,yr,r,x,y							= "drawing elliptic" curves from (x0,y0) to (x,y)
												((r & 0x01FF) % 360) is the x-axis-rotation
												r & 0x0200 is the large-arc-flag
												r & 0x0400 is the sweep-flag
