Spherical Laser Projector Points Protocol 1.0:

Represents a path using binary points.
All arguments are little-endian 16 bits.
Each path start with its length little-endian 16 bits, followed by points x 8 bits, y 8 bits.
All points are relativly to their previous point, the first relatives to 0,0 - left top of path.
Point (0,0) means turn the laser off, each other point turn the laser on and move the motors x and y steps.

examples:
	draw horizontal line from (4,8) to (6,8)
	"\x00\x02\x04\x08\x02\x00"

	draw vertical line from (4,8) to (4,10)
	"\x00\x02\x04\x08\x00\x02"

	draw rect and 2 diagonal lines - house (0xFC is -4)
	"\x00\x07\x04\x04\x04\x00\x00\x04\xFC\x00\x00\xFC\x02\xFC\x02\x04"
