Spherical Laser Projector Path Format 1.0:

Represents paths using binary graphic command(s).
Each command is 8 bits, followed by little-endian 16 bits arguments.
All points are relative to 0,0 - the left top of the path.

command id:
	0	x0,y0				        = "draw start" go to (x0,y0) laser is off
	1	x1,y1				        = "draw line" from (x0,y0) to (x1,y1)
	2	x1,y1,x2,y2			    = "draw quadratic bezier" curve from (x0,y0) to (x2,y2)
	3	x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3	= "draw cubic bezier" curve from (x0,y0) to (x3,y3)
